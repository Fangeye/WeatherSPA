SER421 Lab 5 Activity 2

I was uncertain if this activity should be like lab5act1 or lab4act2 and 3.
I decided to implement lab5act2 as a SPA similar to lab4act2 and 3.

To run my activity 2 program open the weather.html file in your browser.
The weatherView.js file is loaded by the HTML page and handles the API requests.
I added an extra option into the drop down menu that contains a gibberish string.
This option is to demonstrate how my program catches any HTTP errors and renders them.
